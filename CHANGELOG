------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First release. CoolCaptcha is based on an cool-php-captcha.

Besides adapting it to Laravel, CoolCaptcha 1.0
has the following improvements to cool-php-captcha:

+	Big usability improvements. CoolCaptcha actually works out of the box
	and requires basically no configuration. Just one line added in
	bundles.php for bundle loading - which is normal bundle procedure - 
	and you are ready to go!
+	Security improvements: the generated captcha value was previously
	stored in plain text. LaraCaptcha only stores a hash of the captcha,
	and when validating, it compares the hash of the input with the hash
	stored. Basically, this captcha is immune to session hijack.
*	Many bug fixes
*	Code cleanup, redundant code removed
*	Improved documentation of functions
+	Readme file added, providing a quick info and installation guide
+	License file added
+	Changelog file added
+	Support for gif image producing
+	Jpeg file quality
+	All setting moved to config/config.php file
-	Spanish sample words
+	Extra goodies from LaraCaptcha Bundle (Thanks to Vlad Rusu)
