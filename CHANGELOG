------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First release. CoolCaptcha is based on an cool-php-captcha.

1.1

*	Code cleanup
*	Added renewSession method to renew current session for better security option. (Use this after successfully posted form to avoid repeated posts)

Besides adapting it to Laravel, CoolCaptcha 1.0
has the following improvements to cool-php-captcha:

+	Big usability improvements. CoolCaptcha actually works out of the box
	and requires basically no configuration. Just one line added in
	bundles.php for bundle loading - which is normal bundle procedure - 
	and you are ready to go!
+	Security improvements: the generated captcha value was previously
	stored in plain text. LaraCaptcha only stores a hash of the captcha,
	and when validating, it compares the hash of the input with the hash
	stored. Basically, this captcha is immune to session hijack.
*	Many bug fixes
*	Code cleanup, redundant code removed
*	Improved documentation of functions
+	Readme file added, providing a quick info and installation guide
+	License file added
+	Changelog file added
+	Support for gif image producing
+	Jpeg file quality
+	All setting moved to config/config.php file
-	Spanish sample words
+	Extra goodies from LaraCaptcha Bundle (Thanks to Vlad Rusu)
